The missing microlib for websocket communication in the modern web browser. Provides connecting, disconnecting, eventing and listening. Not much else.

## Scope

In the interest of size and speed, the scope of this library extends to **modern broswers only**. Compatibility with older browsers that do not support websockets is not the aim or goal of this lib.
