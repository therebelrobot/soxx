# soxx

The missing microlib for websocket communication in the modern web browser. Provides connecting, disconnecting, eventing and listening. Not much else.

## Scope

In the interest of size and speed, the scope of this library extends to **modern broswers only**. Compatibility with older browsers that do not support websockets is not the aim or goal of this lib.

## Installation

To install Soxx, you first need to get the lib either from the [releases page]() or via NPM:

```bash
npm install soxx
```

Then, you can either include `lib/soxx.js` file in your html file as such:

```html
<script src='path/to/soxx.js'></script>
```

or you can include it via broswerify:

```js
var Soxx = require('soxx')
```

## API

### Instatiation via `connect()`

To start a connection, you need to instatiate the lib:

```js
var opts = {
  protocol:'ws',
  hostname:'echo.websocket.org',
  path:'/?encoding=text'
}
var socket = Soxx.connect(opts)
```

Once instantiated, you can assign listeners, and fire events back to the server.

### Communication with server

This library implements a very simple eventing system. All data passed into `emit()` is added to an object with `event` and `data` defined. After being added, it is passed through `JSON.stringify()` and sent to the server. Data recieved back from the server is expected in the same format.

Example:

```json
{
  "event": "CoolEvent",
  "data": { "foo": "bar" }
}
```

You can bypass these settings by setting them in the opts object during instantiation. Be aware, if you set a new `onmessage` that some functionality described below may break.

### Listeners via `on()`

To assign a listener to an event:

```js
socket.on('CoolEvent', function(data){
  console.log('event fired!', data)
})
```

*Note: only one function can be assigned per event right now. Will expand this later*

To unassign, simply run `off()`

```js
socket.off('CoolEvent')
```

### Fire events via `emit()`

To fire events back to the server:

```js
var dataToSend = {foo:'bar'}
socket.emit('CoolEvent', dataToSend, function(){
  console.log('emit callback')
})
```

### Verbose Mode

To have more granular info about your events, set the `verbose` flag to `true` in `opts` on instantiation.
